              My daughter and I were in on Saturday June 2nd for an updo and makeup for my vow renewal ceremony. We
              are from out of town, but you would never know. They made us feel at home and like I had been going
              there for years. I have never felt so beautiful and my daughter looked stunning! I highly recommend
              Helene's Magic Mirror for weddings/proms :)

              Great Place for Hair, Nails, Tanning – They know what they are doing. They listen to what you want.They
              show you how to maintain your style. My 19 year old daughter has been trying to get a style for years now,
              but no one would listen to her, or give her the cut she wanted, until she had her hair cut at Helene's.
              She lives out of state, and whenever she comes home the first thing she wants to do is to get an appt. to
              get her hair done. It's the only place my 24 yr old will get sprayed tanned at because it looks natural,
              unlike some other spray tanning places. I like it too the atmosphere is so comfortable, and the people are
              so nice, and the prices are so reasonable. This is the best beauty shop I have ever been to!!!!

              trys to fit everyone in to appointments. She is kind and good hearted.She has been in the business for 30
              years and loves it. She goes to classes to keep herself educated on all new and upcoming styles and
              trends. She also does hair extensions wonderfully. She has been doing my and my friends for many years.
              Today she did my hair color and why I was waiting for processing, she made a customer so happy that she
              cried because Helene had a hairpiece to match her hair. The lady could not believe her eyes she finally
              had hair. Helene takes a lot of pride in what she does. So if your looking for a great shop and great
              people go to Helene's. Jillian is great a makeup tech. relaxing facials and Helenes right girl.

              Helene's has always had great service! The women who work there (and gentleman) have great personalities
              and skills. Willing to accomadate you, even if it means staying after hours or coming in early for you.
              I've been going to Bev almost my whole life and Helene is amazing. Their nails, make-up, and spray tan are
              also superior! I have gotten many spray tans and have not once been orange, they make sure you aren't
              streaked or orange.
              I always tell my friends to go there!

              Been going here since I was a baby all the ladies make you feel like you're part of the family and will
              always do their best to get you an appointment and make sure you're satisfied. Both the shampoo girls are
              exquisite and gentle. Once you come here you never want to stop going here.
