                    My daughter and I were in on Saturday June 2nd for an updo and makeup for my vow renewal ceremony. We
                    are from out of town, but you would never know. They made us feel at home and like I had been going
                    there for years. I have never felt so beautiful and my daughter looked stunning! I highly recommend
                    Helene's Magic Mirror for weddings/proms :)

                    Great Place for Hair, Nails, Tanning – They know what they are doing. They listen to what you want.They
                    show you how to maintain your style. My 19 year old daughter has been trying to get a style for years now,
                    but no one would listen to her, or give her the cut she wanted, until she had her hair cut at Helene's.
                    She lives out of state, and whenever she comes home the first thing she wants to do is to get an appt. to
                    get her hair done. It's the only place my 24 yr old will get sprayed tanned at because it looks natural,
                    unlike some other spray tanning places. I like it too the atmosphere is so comfortable, and the people are
                    so nice, and the prices are so reasonable. This is the best beauty shop I have ever been to!!!!

                    Helene's has always had great service! The women who work there (and gentleman) have great personalities
                    and skills. Willing to accomadate you, even if it means staying after hours or coming in early for you.
                    I've been going to Bev almost my whole life and Helene is amazing. Their nails, make-up, and spray tan are
                    also superior! I have gotten many spray tans and have not once been orange, they make sure you aren't
                    streaked or orange.
                    I always tell my friends to go there!
